Hey there, 
In this project I scrape the Basketball reference NBA website, to analyze the players by using powerful libraries:
* Pandas
* Seaborn

The exercise of this project is to:
* To scrape the data from a website
* Analize the data and see how some behaviors are
* Change data types and sort values 
* Export data to excel 
* Get a set of the 10 top players based on points

So lets get, to the code!!
