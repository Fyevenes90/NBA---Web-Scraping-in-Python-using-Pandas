# NBA---Web-Scraping-in-Python-using-Pandas
Hey there, 
In this project I scrape the Basketball reference NBA website, to analyze the players by using powerful libraries:
 -Pandas
 -seaborn

The exercise of this project is:
*to scrape the data from a website
*Analize the data and see how some behaviors are
*Change data types and sort values 
*Export data to excel 
*Get a set of the 10 top players based on points

So lets get to the code!!
